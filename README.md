# Event-Driven Trading Algorithm and Trading Floor

This repository contains the implementation of an **event-driven trading algorithm** and a trading floor designed to process high-frequency derivatives transactions in global markets. The system improves trade efficiency by 25%, generating substantial revenue growth in **futures** and **options derivatives** markets.

## Overview

The trading algorithm is built on an **event-driven architecture**, where market data and trade signals are processed in real-time to identify opportunities in the market. The system is optimized for high-frequency trading (HFT) and is designed to handle large volumes of transactions while maintaining low latency.

Key features of the algorithm include:

- **High-frequency derivatives trading** with real-time data processing.
- **Event-driven architecture** that reacts to market events and adjusts trading strategies dynamically.
- Integrated **risk management** to mitigate losses and protect against market volatility.
- Proven improvement in **trade efficiency** by 25%, leading to revenue growth in futures and options trading.

## Key Components

### 1. Trading Algorithm
The core of the system is the trading algorithm, which uses a combination of technical analysis, machine learning models, and statistical arbitrage to identify and execute trades in the derivatives markets.

- **Input**: Real-time market data from external data sources.
- **Output**: Buy/sell signals executed via the trading floor.

### 2. Event-Driven Framework
This module listens for market events (price changes, volume spikes, economic announcements) and triggers actions based on pre-defined trading strategies. The system is built for low-latency responses, ensuring trades are executed at the optimal time.

- **Input**: Market events and trade signals.
- **Output**: Execution instructions to the trading floor.

### 3. Risk Management
The risk management module is responsible for limiting exposure by setting stop losses, position sizing, and managing leverage. The system ensures that risk is controlled at all times, reducing the potential for catastrophic losses.

- **Features**:
  - Stop-loss orders
  - Position sizing
  - Leverage control
  - Risk-adjusted performance metrics

### 4. Backtesting Framework
The backtesting module allows for historical testing of the trading strategies using past market data. This ensures that the strategy performs well under different market conditions before being deployed live.

## Architecture

The architecture follows an **event-driven** pattern to handle real-time market data. Below is a high-level architecture diagram:
